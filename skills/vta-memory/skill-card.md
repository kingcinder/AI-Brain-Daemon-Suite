## Description: <br>
Reward and motivation system for AI agents. Dopamine-like wanting, not just doing. Part of the AI Brain series. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>
[ImpKind](https://clawhub.ai/user/ImpKind) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agent users use this skill to add a persistent motivation and reward-state layer to OpenClaw-style agents, including drive tracking, reward logging, anticipation, and session state summaries. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Persistent motivation and memory files may contain sensitive or unwanted conversation-derived content. <br>
Mitigation: Install only when persistent agent-wide motivation state is desired, and review or delete ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/*, ~/.openclaw/workspace/VTA_STATE.md, and ~/.openclaw/workspace/brain-dashboard.html when needed. <br>
Risk: Auto-injected motivation state can shape future agent behavior. <br>
Mitigation: Inspect the generated VTA_STATE.md before relying on it in sessions, and remove or edit it if the behavior influence is unwanted. <br>
Risk: The optional --with-cron install path can run recurring transcript and reward processing. <br>
Mitigation: Avoid --with-cron unless recurring processing is acceptable, and review any created OpenClaw cron jobs after installation. <br>

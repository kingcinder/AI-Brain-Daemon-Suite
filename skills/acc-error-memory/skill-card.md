## Description: <br>
Error pattern tracking for AI agents. Detects corrections, escalates recurring mistakes, learns mitigations. The 'something's off' detector from the AI Brain series. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>
[ImpKind](https://clawhub.ai/user/ImpKind) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agent operators use this skill to detect user corrections or frustration in OpenClaw session transcripts, track recurring error patterns, and load learned mitigations at the start of later sessions. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill reads OpenClaw session transcripts and creates persistent memory from conversation content. <br>
Mitigation: Install only for workspaces where transcript review and persistent memory are acceptable, and periodically inspect or delete the generated workspace memory files. <br>
Risk: Configured model commands can receive excerpts from user and assistant exchanges during screening or calibration. <br>
Mitigation: Use local or explicitly trusted ACC_MODELS commands, and avoid enabling recurring analysis for sensitive work. <br>
